The directory "castle-engine-output" is a temporary directory for
the auto-generated files created by the Castle Game Engine build tool
(called "castle-engine"). It also contains files generated by various
external programs called by the build tool (Free Pascal Compiler,
Gradle for Android, ...).
See https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/wiki/Build-Tool
for more information about the Castle Game Engine build tool.

The files here are often overwritten and removed, and storing them
in a version control repository is generally not useful.

So you SHOULD NOT add and commit this file to a version control
(like SVN or GIT).

Insted you SHOULD make this whole directory ("castle-engine-output")
ignored by your version control system, to not be bothered by this directory
existence. For example, use:

- SVN "ignore" system
  ( http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.advanced.props.special.ignore.html )
- or GIT .gitignore file
  ( https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore )
- or any analogous method in other version control systems.
