  Material and texture properties. This allows to configure some material/texture
  properties that would be uncomfortable to express inside 3D files
  (or impossible because 3D authoring software does no support it).
  For example, footsteps sound when player walks over given ground.

  <!-- Automatically compress textures.
    Most of them to DXT1 (without alpha),
    some of them to DXT5 (with smooth alpha).

    Note that the engine assumes that *all* DXT5 textures should
    use blending when rendering (since we cannot detect alpha channel
    type in a compressed data). So *you cannot* just blindly compress
    everything to DXT5 or to DXT1, you have to choose, like we show
    below.

    Run "castle-engine auto-generate-textures" to create or update the DDS files
    with compressed textures. You will need to install first:
    - build tool: https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/wiki/Build-Tool
    - one of the supported tools to compress to DXTn, see
      https://castle-engine.sourceforge.io/creating_data_material_properties.php#section_texture_compression
      We advice the "NVidia Texture Tools" (libnvtt-bin package on Linux).

    The Castle Game Engine will automatically use the compressed textures.
