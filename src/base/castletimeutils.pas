  { Time in seconds. This is used throughout my engine to represent time
    as a floating-point value with good accuracy in seconds.

    Using the "double" precision (not just "single") is good to guarantee
    good accuracy. It is also the precision required for storing time in X3D.

    To test that "single" is not enough, open some animation in
    view3dscene, and change "on display" time pass to 1000.
    It goes even better if AutoRedisplay is @false, and LimitFPS is 0.0,
    and model is still for some time --- then we do many OnUpdate calls with
    very small SecondsPassed values. }

{ Check is SecondTime larger by at least TimeDelay than FirstTime.

  Simple implementation of this would be @code(SecondTime - FirstTime >= TimeDelay).

  FirstTime and SecondTime are milisecond times from some initial point.
  For example, they may be taken from a function like 32-bit GetTickCount
  (on older Windows; on newer we use GetTickCount64).
  Such time may "wrap".
  This function checks these times intelligently, using the assumption that
  the SecondTime is always "later" than the FirstTime, and only having to check
  if it's later by at least TimeDelay.

{ Current time, local to this process.
  Use this to measure and compare the time it takes your program to do
  some calculations.

  If possible, this measures only the CPU usage of this process.
  So it ignores delays caused by other processes doing something on your system,
  and it ignores things like waiting for hard disk (I/O).
  This is possible on Unix thanks to the @code(clock) API,
  see http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Processor-And-CPU-Time.html .
  On other platforms (like Windows), this simply measures real time that passed.

  You usually take two ProcessTimer values,
  subtract them with @link(ProcessTimerSeconds),
  and this is the time that passed -- in seconds. Like this:

  @longCode(#
  var
    TimeStart: TProcessTimerResult;
    Seconds: TFloatTime;
  begin
    TimeStart := ProcessTimer;
    // ...  do something time-consuming ...
    Seconds := ProcessTimerSeconds(ProcessTimer, TimeStart);
    // or: Seconds := TimeStart.ElapsedTime;

  end;

}
function ProcessTimer: TProcessTimerResult;

function ProcessTimerNow: TProcessTimerResult; deprecated 'use ProcessTimer';

{ Subtract two times obtained from @link(ProcessTimer),
  A-B, return a difference in ProcessTimersPerSec.

  Although it may just subtract two values, it may also do something more.
  For example, if timer resolution is only miliseconds, and it may wrap
  (just like TMilisecTime), then we may subtract values intelligently,
  taking into account that time could wrap (see TimeTickDiff). }
function ProcessTimerDiff(a, b: TProcessTimerResult): TProcessTimerResult;

{ Simple measure of process CPU time. Call ProcessTimerBegin at the beginning
  of your calculation, call ProcessTimerEnd at the end. ProcessTimerEnd
  returns a float number, with 1.0 being one second.

  Note that using this is unsafe in libraries, not to mention multi-threaded
  programs (it's not "reentrant") --- you risk that some other code
  called ProcessTimerBegin, and your ProcessTimerEnd doesn't measure
  what you think. So in general units, do not use this, use @link(ProcessTimer)
  and @link(ProcessTimerSeconds) instead.

  It is a "real" time, which means that subtracting two values measures
  the actual time that passed between two events.
  Contrast this with @link(ProcessTimer) that tries to measure
  only CPU time used by the current process.

  Call Timer twice, and calculate the difference (in seconds)
  using the TimerSeconds. Like this:

  @longCode(#

      like OnUpdate, and it doesn't take into account that frames are possibly
      not rendered continously (when AutoRedisplay = @false, we may render
      frames seldom, because there's no need to do it more often).

      of EventRender (OnRender) calls per second. This means that it's actual
      speed of your program. Anything can slow this down, not only long
      EventRender (OnRender), but also slow processing of other events (like OnUpdate).
      Also, when AutoRedisplay = @false, this may be very low, since you
      just don't need to render frames continously.

      @seealso FrameTime }
    property RealTime: TFloatTime read FRealTime;

    { Track how much time passed since last Update call, using _UpdateBegin.

      The time is in seconds, 1.0 = 1 second.
      For two times faster computer UpdateSecondsPassed = 0.5,
      for two times slower UpdateSecondsPassed = 2.0. This is useful for doing
      time-based rendering, when you want to scale some changes
      by computer speed, to get perceived animation speed the same on every
      computer, regardless of computer's speed.

      This is calculated as a time between
      start of previous Update event and start of current Update event.
      So this really measures your whole loop time (unlike previous RenderSpeed
      that measured only EventRender (OnRender) speed).

      You can sanely use this only within EventUpdate (OnUpdate). }

    { Forces UpdateSecondsPassed for the next Update call (using _UpdateBegin)
      to be zero.

      This is useful if you just came back from some lenghty
      state, like a GUI dialog box (like TCastleWindowCustom.FileDialog or modal boxes
      in CastleMessages --- but actually all our stuff already calls this
      as needed, TGLMode takes care of this). UpdateSecondsPassed would be ridicoulously
      long in such case (if our loop is totally stopped) or not relevant
      (if we do our loop, but with totally different callbacks, like
      CastleMessages). Instead, it's most sensible in such case to fake
      that UpdateSecondsPassed is 0.0, so things such as TCastleSceneCore.Time
      should not advance wildly just because we did GUI box.

      This forces the UpdateSecondsPassed to zero only once, that is only on the
      next update event (_UpdateBegin). Following update event (_UpdateBegin) will have
      UpdateSecondsPassed as usual (unless you call ZeroNextSecondsPassed again, of course). }
    procedure ZeroNextSecondsPassed;

    { Time of last Update call. }
    property UpdateStartTime: TTimerResult read FUpdateStartTime;

    { Current frame identifier.

      Changed when each container "update" event occurs,
      so this is equal during all @link(TInputListener.Update),
      @link(TUIControl.Render), @link(TCastleTransform.Update),
      @link(TCastleTransform.LocalRender) occuring within the same frame.
      You can use this to avoid performing the same job many times
      in a single frame.

      Never zero.

      It's a class function, so you can access it like
      @code(TFramesPerSecond.FrameId),
      no need to have a TFramesPerSecond instance (which is usually
      accessed from TUIContainer, like @link(TUIContainer.Fps),
      @link(TCastleWindowCustom.Fps), @link(TCastleControlCustom.Fps). }

      This way they don't change rapidly.

      Previously we used more elaborate hacks for this (resetting
      their times after a longer periods, but keeping some previous
      results), but they were complex and bad: when the game speed
      was changing suddenly, FRealTime, FFrameTime should also change
      suddenly, not gradually increase / decrease. }

    FRealTime := FramesRendered / TimerSeconds(NowTime, LastRecalculateTime);

    if FrameTimePassed.Value > 0 then
      FFrameTime := FramesRendered * TimerFrequency / FrameTimePassed.Value
    else
      FFrameTime := 0;

    LastRecalculateTime := NowTime;
    FramesRendered := 0;
    FrameTimePassed.Value := 0;
  end;
end;

procedure TFramesPerSecond._UpdateBegin;
var
  NewUpdateStartTime: TTimerResult;
begin
  { update FUpdateSecondsPassed, DoZeroNextSecondsPassed, FUpdateStartTime }
  NewUpdateStartTime := Timer;

  if DoZeroNextSecondsPassed then
  begin
    FUpdateSecondsPassed := 0.0;
    DoZeroNextSecondsPassed := false;
  end else
  begin
    FUpdateSecondsPassed := TimerSeconds(NewUpdateStartTime, FUpdateStartTime);
    if MaxSensibleSecondsPassed > 0 then
      FUpdateSecondsPassed := Min(FUpdateSecondsPassed, MaxSensibleSecondsPassed);
  end;

  FUpdateStartTime := NewUpdateStartTime;

  Inc(FFrameId);
end;

procedure TFramesPerSecond.ZeroNextSecondsPassed;

  DoZeroNextSecondsPassed := true;

class function TFramesPerSecond.FrameId: Int64;
