  { These are various features that may be freed by
    TCastleSceneCore.FreeResources.

    @italic(Warning): This is for experienced usage of TCastleSceneCore.
    Everything is explained in detail below, but still  --- if you have some
    doubts, or you just don't observe any memory shortage in your program,
    it's probably best to not use TCastleSceneCore.FreeResources.

    @unorderedList(
      @item(For frTextureDataInNodes, frBackgroundImageInNodes and TrianglesList,
        if you will free them unnecessarily
        (i.e. you will use it after you freed it), it will be automatically
        recreated on next use. So everything will work correctly, but you
        will experience unnecessary slowdown if we will need to recreate
        exactly the same resource over and over again.)

      @item(For frTextureDataInNodes and frBackgroundImageInNodes note that
        freeing these resources too eagerly may make texture cache
        (see TextureImages) less effective. In normal circumstances,
        if you will use the same cache instance throughout the program,
        loaded images are reused. If you free frTextureDataInNodes
        too early, you may remove them from the cache too early, and lose
        a chance to reuse them. So you may cause unnecessary slowdown
        of preparing models, e.g. inside PrepareResources.)

  TSceneFreeResource = (
    { Unloads the texture images/videos allocated in texture nodes.

      It's useful if you know that you already prepared everything
      that needed the texture images, and you will not need texture images
      later. For TCastleScene this means that you use Optimization
      method other than roNone,
      and you already did PrepareResources (so textures are already loaded to OpenGL),
      and your code will not access TextureImage / TextureVideo anymore.
      This is commonly @true for various games.

      Then you can call this to free some resources.

      Note that if you made an accident and you will use some TextureImage or
      TextureVideo after FreeResources, then you will get no crash,
      but texture image will be simply reloaded. So you may experience
      slowdown if you inappropriately use this feature. }

    { Create @italic(and keep up-to-date) a spatial structure
      containing all visible shapes.
      It's useful for "frustum culling", it will be automatically
      used by TCastleScene rendering to speed it up.

      This octree will be automatically updated on dynamic scenes
      (when e.g. animation moves some shape by changing it's transformation). }
    ssRendering,

    { Create @italic(and keep up-to-date) a spatial structure
      containing all collidable shapes (and then reaching
      into collidable triangles for a specifc shape).
      It is automatically used by the XxxCollision methods in this class.

      This is actually a hierarchy of octrees: scene is partitioned
      first into Shapes (each instance of VRML/X3D geometry node),
      and then each Shape has an octree of triangles inside.

      This octree is useful for all kinds of collision detection.
      Compared to ssStaticCollisions, it is (very slightly on typical scenes)
      less efficient, but it can also be updated very fast.
      For example, merely transforming some Shape means that only
      one item needs to be moved in the top-level shape tree.
      So this is the most important structure for collision detection on
      dynamic scenes. }
    ssDynamicCollisions,

    { Create a spatial structure containing all visible triangles, suitable only
      for scenes that stay static.

      It's primarily use is for ray-tracers, that make a lot of collision queries
      to the same scene in the same time. When rendering using OpenGL,
      this has no use currently.

      This structure is not updated on scene changes. In fact, the scene
      contents cannot change when this octree is created --- as this octree
      keeps pointers to some states that may become invalid in dynamic scenes. }
    ssVisibleTriangles,

    { Create a spatial structure containing all collidable triangles,
      @bold(only for scenes that never change).

      It may be useful if you're absolutely sure that you have a static scene
      (nothing changes, i.e. ProcessEvents = @false and you never
      make any change to X3D nodes from code) and
      you want to have collision detection with the scene.

      For dynamic scenes, using this is a bad idea as
      this octree is not updated on scene changes. In fact, the scene
      contents cannot change when this octree is created --- as this octree
      keeps pointers to some states that may become invalid in dynamic scenes.
      Use ssDynamicCollisions for dynamic scenes. }

  TGeometryChange =
  ( { Everything changed. All octrees must be rebuild, old State pointers
      may be invalid.

      Every ChangedAll call does this.
      ChangedAll must take into account that everything could change.
      Note that ChangedAll traverses the VRML/X3D graph again,
      recalculating State values... so the old States are not
      correct anymore. You have to rebuild the octree or your pointers
      will be bad.

      When DoGeometryChanged with gcAll is called, we know that ChangedAll
      called this, and every TShape will be (or already is) destroyed
      and created new. }
    gcAll,

    { Transformation of some shape changed.
      @groupBegin }
    gcCollidableTransformChanged,

    { Local geometry change
      happened (actual octree free is already done by
      TShape.LocalGeometryChanged, octree create will be done at next demand).
      We should update stuff at higher (TCastleSceneCore) level accordingly.

      gcLocalGeometryChangedCoord means that coordinates changed.
      Compared to gcLocalGeometryChanged, this means that model edges
      structure remains the same (this is helpful e.g. to avoid
      recalculating Manifold/BorderEdges).

      In this case, DoGeometryChanged parameter LocalGeometryShape is non-nil
      and indicated the (only) shape that changed.

  { Loading and processing of a scene.
    Almost everything visible in your game will be an instance of
    @link(TCastleScene), which is a descendant of this class that adds rendering
    capabilities.

    This class provides a lot of functionality, like loading of the scene
    (@link(Load) method), animating it, performing collisions with the scene,
    and calculating things (like @link(LocalBoundingBox)).

    The actual scene information (visible and collidable things) is inside
    X3D nodes graph contained within the @link(RootNode).
    During the lifetime of the scene, this X3D graph can change
    (e.g. because of animations), and you can always change it by code
    too. E.g. you can freely change @link(TTransformNode.Translation)
    or add children by @link(TX3DRootNode.AddChildren).
    The X3D nodes graph works like a DOM tree for rendering HTML documents:
    it's typically initialized from a file (3D model), but during
    the game execution it is dynamic, always changing.

    This class takes care of performing the X3D events
    and routes mechanism (if @link(ProcessEvents) is @true).
    This is what allows X3D graph to be animated, or even be interactive
    (respond to user actions).
    For a simple way to play animations, use the @link(PlayAnimation) method.

    This class maintains a @link(Shapes) tree is
    always synchronized with the X3D nodes tree in @link(RootNode).
    The @link(Shapes) tree provides a little simple view at the scene,
    sometimes easier (or faster) to iterate over.

    Many results are cached, so querying them multiple times is fast,
    if the scene does not change (in a significant way) between each query.
    So you can query information like @link(LocalBoundingBox),
    @link(BoundingBox), @link(VerticesCount)... as often as you want to. }

      Note that OverTriangulate parameter for Triangulate call above is @false:
      it shouldn't be needed to have triangle octree with over-triangulate
      (over-triangulate is only for rendering with Gouraud shading).

      If Collidable, then only the collidable, or at least "pickable",
      triangles are generated. Which means that children of
      Collision nodes with collide = FALSE (or proxy <> nil) are not placed here.
      Otherwise, only the visible (not necessarily collidable)
      items are placed in the octree.

      If ProgressTitle <> '' (and progress is not active already,
      so we avoid starting "progress bar within progress bar",
      and progress user interface is initialized)
      then it uses @link(Progress) while building octree.

      Remember that triangle octree has references to Shape nodes
      inside RootNode VRML/X3D tree and to State objects inside
      our @link(Shapes) tree.
      And shape octree has references to our @link(Shapes) tree.
      So you must rebuild such octree when this object changes.

      Note: remember that this is a function and it returns
      created octree object. It does *not* set value of any
      OctreeXxx property, and the returned octree is not managed
      by this scene.

      Everything in my units is done in the spirit
      that you can create as many octrees as you want for a given scene
      (both octrees based on triangles and based on shapes).
      Also, in some special cases an octree may be constructed in
      some special way (not only using @link(CreateShapeOctree)
      or @link(CreateTriangleOctree)) so that it doesn't contain
      the whole scene from some TCastleSceneCore object, or it contains
      the scene from many TCastleSceneCore objects, or something else.

      What I want to say is that it's generally wrong to think of
      an octree as something that maps 1-1 to some TCastleSceneCore object.
      Octrees, as implemented here, are a lot more flexible.

    { Change current scene time, setting @link(Time).
      It is crucial that you call this continously to have some VRML/X3D
      time-dependent features working, like TimeSensor and MovieTexture.
      See @link(Time) for details what is affected by this.

      This is automatically taken care of if you added this scene
      to TCastleWindowCustom.Controls or TCastleControlCustom.Controls.
      Then our @link(Update) takes care of doing the job,
      according to TimePlaying and TimePlayingSpeed.

      This causes time to be passed to appropriate time-dependent nodes,
      events will be called etc.

      SetTime and IncreaseTime do exactly the same, the difference is
      only that for IncreaseTime you specify increase in the time
      (that is, NewTime = @link(Time) + TimeIncrease). Use whichever version
      is more handy.

      Following X3D specification, time should only grow. So NewValue should
      be > @link(Time) (or TimeIncrease > 0).
      Otherwise we ignore this call.
      For resetting the time (when you don't necessarily want to grow @link(Time))
      see ResetTime.

      If a change of Time will produce some visible change in the VRML/X3D model
      (for example, MovieTexture will change, or TimeSensor change will be
      routed by interpolator to coordinates of some visible node) it
      will be reported by usual method, that is VisibleChangeHere.

      Increasing this "drives" the animations (by increasing
      time of time-dependent nodes like X3D TimeSensor, which in turn
      drive the rest of the animation).

      You can use @link(SetTime) or @link(IncreaseTime) to move time
      forward manually. But usually there's no need for it:
      our @link(Update) method takes care of it automatically,
      you only need to place the scene inside @link(TCastleSceneManager.Items).

      You can start/stop time progress by @link(TimePlaying)
      and scale it by @link(TimePlayingSpeed). These properties
      affect how the time is updated by the @link(Update) method
      (so if you use @link(SetTime) or @link(IncreaseTime) methods,
      you're working around these properties).

      Default time value is 0.0 (zero). However it will be reset
      at load to a current time (seconds since Unix epoch ---
      that's what X3D standard says to use, although you can change
      it by KambiNavigationInfo.timeOriginAtLoad,
      see http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/x3d_implementation_navigation_extensions.php#section_ext_time_origin_at_load ).

      There may be a delay between calling PlayAnimation and actually

      This is often a desirable optimization. There's often no "rush" to

      the nearest @link(Update) call is acceptable.
      It also means that calling @link(PlayAnimation) multiple times

      Using "spatial structures" allows to achieve various things:

          Using any of these flags allows to resolve collisions with
          the (collidable) triangles of the model.
          By default, every shape is collidable, but you can use the
          @link(TCollisionNode) to turn collisions off for some shapes
          (or replace them with simpler objects
          for the collision-detection purposes).

          As for the distinction between these two flags,
          ssDynamicCollisions and ssStaticCollisions:
          Almost always you should use ssDynamicCollisions.
          The speedup of ssStaticCollisions is very small,
          and sometimes it costs memory usage (as shapes cannot be reused),
          and ssStaticCollisions may cause crashes if the model
          accidentally changes.

          If you use neither @bold(ssDynamicCollisions) nor @bold(ssStaticCollisions),
          then the collisions are resolved using the whole scene bounding
          box. That is, treating the whole scene as a giant cube.

          You can always toggle @link(Collides) to quickly make
          the scene not collidable.)

        @item(@bold(ssRendering):

          Using this adds an additional optimization during rendering.
          This allows to use frustum culling with an octree.

          Using this is adviced, if your camera usually only sees
          a small portion of the scene. For example,
          a typical level / location in a game usually qualifies.)

          quickly. This mostly useful only for ray-tracers.)

            "Events are not generated if the geometry itself is
            animating and moving underneath the pointing device."

            I understand that they mean that you don't have to call
            PointingDeviceMove continously, you can only check this on
            actual mouse move. That is, isOver state changes are not
            intended to be caught immediately if they happened because
            the geometry is animating. But, still, all isOver changes *are*
            reported. I hope they don't mean that isOver changes because
            of underlying geometry animating should not be reported at all.

            The latter interpretation:
            - Would be unhandy for implementation, as I would have to call
              raycollision twice for each Motion (to get
              OverItemBeforeMove and OverItem).
            - Would be unhandy for users. You want
              to catch isOver changes eventually, right? Otherwise,
              user may be forced to move mouse out and then back in to generate
              isOver event = TRUE. Worse, user has to move mouse inside and
              then back outside to generate isOver = FALSE event.

          elapsedTime events (elapsedTime causes also fraction_changed).
          Sending of further elapsedTime means that two animations try to play
          at the same time, and modify the same transforms.

          One way to stop animation is to set

            PlayingAnimationNode.StopTime := Time;

          While it works in practice (no reproducible bug with it found),
          it has 2 problems:

          - There will be 1 additional frame when TimeSensor "finishes of"
            the animation, by remaining "TimeIncrease - (NewTime - FdStopTime.Value)"
            duration. This isn't a problem in practice, since it only happens for 1 frame
            (then the old TimeSensor becomes inactive), but it stil feels dirty/wasteful.

          - In case you will move time backwards, e.g. by ResetTime or ResetTimeAtLoad,
            you may get into trouble.
            You may accidentally activate a time sensor that is
            inactive now, but was active long time ago.

          To overcome the 2nd problem, we tried the trick below.
          It will work assuming you never reset time to something < 1.
          (If you do reset time to something very small, then typical TimeSensors will
          have problems anyway,
          see http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/x3d_time_origin_considered_uncomfortable.php ).

            PlayingAnimationNode.StartTime := 0;
            PlayingAnimationNode.StopTime := 1;
            PlayingAnimationNode.Loop := false;

          But this:
          - Still has the "1 additional frame when TimeSensor finishes of" dirtyness.
          - Also, setting startTime while time-dependent node is active is ignored,
            X3D spec requires this, see our TSFTimeIgnoreWhenActive implementation.
            (bug reproduction: escape_universe, meteorite_1 dying).
            Although we remove this problem by NeverIgnore hack.
          - Also, it's bad to unconditionally set "Loop" value.
            If user is using paDefault for animation, (s)he expects
            that PlayAnimation doesn't change it ever.

          So it's simpest and reliable to just set enabled=false on old TimeSensor.
          TInternalTimeDependentHandler.SetTime then guarantees it will immediately stop
          sending elapsedTime events. }
