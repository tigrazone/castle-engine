      sources (see @link(Importance) and to keep MaxAllocatedSources)
      and we must assign this OpenAL sound slot to something else,
      or it may stop be used because it simply stopped playing.

      When this event occurs, you should forget (e.g. set to @nil) all
      your references to this sound instance. That's because this TSound instance
      may be freed (or reused for other sounds) after calling OnRelease.
      For the same reason, right after calling this event, we always clear it
      (set OnRelease to @nil).

      It's guaranteed that when this will be called,
      @link(Used) will be @false and @link(PlayingOrPaused) will be @false.

      as @false and will call OnRelease. Otherwise we would have to
      get source state at some time (they are checked in AllocateSound)

      is ignored.

      This offset refers to the sound like it had a @link(Pitch) equal 1.0
      (when the sound is not slowed down or sped up).
      So this offset will vary from 0 to the @italic(sound buffer duration),
      regardless of the current @link(Pitch) value.
      The @italic(actual) seconds passed since the sound started
      playing may be different, if you will change the @link(Pitch)
      to something else than 1.0.

      Setting this on a not-yet playing sound source
      (this is done by @link(TSoundEngine.PlaySound))
      causes the sound to start playing from that offset. }

      returned by TSoundAllocator.AllocateSound, when it stops being @true

      and OnRelease being automatically called, and this TSound may then
      be reused for playing other sounds. }
    function PlayingOrPaused: boolean;

    { Make sure that the sound keeps playing, in case it stopped playing.

      This is an alternative approach to play a sound many times,
      like in a loop, but without using the @link(Loop) property.
      The idea is that you leave @link(Loop) set to @false,
      and you keep calling this method from some "update" event
      (like some @link(TUIControl.Update) implementation).
      Once you stop calling this method, the sound will automatically stop
      (once it finishes the current cycle).

      Note that you still (as always when using TSound) must observe
      the @link(TSound.OnRelease). When it's called, it means that the sound
      engine (TSoundEngine) decided that this sound should be used for other purposes
      (there's also a very small chance that the sound engine "caught"
      the sound as unused, in a short time when it stopped playing but you didn't
      yet call this method).
      In such case, you must stop doing anything with this TSound instance
      (including calling this method, @name, on it).
      You have to start playing the sound again by @link(TSoundEngine.PlaySound)
      instead.

      Note that calling this method is better than observing @link(TSound.OnRelease),
      to start playing a new sound when the previous one stopped.
      That's because @link(TSound.OnRelease) may be called with some small delay
      after the sound actually stopped, and it may be noticeable (e.g. in case
      of using this for a short rhytmic sound, like footsteps). }

      starting from the sound with largest Importance, and so on

  { Manager of allocated OpenAL sounds.
    You leave to this class creating and deleting of OpenAL sounds.
    When you need OpenAL sound to do something, just call AllocateSound method.

    This class will manage OpenAL sources in an intelligent manner,
    which means when you need new sound, we may
    @orderedList(
      @item(Reuse already allocated sound that is not used to play anything.)
      @item(Allocate new sound (but we will keep allocated sounds count
        within MaxAllocatedSources sound limit, to not overload OpenAL
        implementation with work).)
      @item(We may simply interrupt already allocated sound, if new
        sound is more important.)
    )

    Our OpenAL resources are created in ALContextOpen, and released
    in ALContextClose.

    The very reason behind this class is to hide from you the fact that
    the number of OpenAL sources are limited. In particular, this
    means that when OpenAL will run out of sources, no OpenAL error
    (alGetError) will be left, and no exception will be raised.
    In the worst case TSoundAllocator.AllocateSound will return nil,
    but in more probable cases some other sources (unused, or with
    less priority) will be reused.

    Note that this means that the code in this unit must
    read in some situations alGetError. That's because reading alGetError
    is the only way to know when OpenAL implementation has run out of sources.
    So the code in this unit may in various places raise EALError if you
    made some error in your OpenAL code, and you didn't check alGetError
    yourself often enough. }

      as unused (and recycled for another sound) at the next AllocateSound,

      may be stopped because the sounds are needed for other sounds.

      These are used only for spatialized sounds created with PlaySound.
      The DefaultReferenceDistance and DefaultMaxDistance values
      are used only if you don't supply explicit values to PlaySound.

      The exact interpretation of these depends on current

        @item(Smaller Rolloff Factor makes the attenuation weaker.

          gain is heard. Default is 1.)
        @item(Max Distance interpretation depends on the model.
          For "inverse clamped model", the gain is no longer scaled down
          after reaching this distance. For linear models, the gain
          reaches zero at this distance. Default is maximum float
          (I don't know the interpretation of this for linear model).)

      version. Older OpenAL versions may (but don't have to) support them
      through extensions. We will internally do everything possible to
      request given model, but eventually may fallback on some other model.
      This probably will not be a problem in practice, as all modern OS
      versions (Linux distros, Windows OpenAL installers etc.) include OpenAL
      1.1.

      The default distance model, DefaultDistanceModel, is the linear model

  { Sound information, internally used by TRepoSoundEngine.

    The fields correspond to appropriate attributes in sounds XML file.
    All of the fields except Buffer are initialized only by ReadSounds.

    From the point of view of end-user the number of sounds
    is constant for given game and their properties (expressed in
    TSoundInfo below) are also constant.
    However, for the sake of debugging/testing the game,
    and for content designers, the actual values of Sounds are loaded
    at initialization by ReadSounds (called automatically by ALContextOpen)
    from sounds XML file,
    and later can be changed by calling ReadSounds once again during the
    game (debug menu may have command like "Reload sounds/index.xml"). }

      Empty means that the sound data is not defined,
      so the OpenAL buffer will not be initialized and trying to play
      this sound (with methods like TSoundEngine.Sound or TSoundEngine.Sound3D)
      will do nothing. This is useful if you want to use a sound name
      in code, but you do not have the actual sound file for this yet. }
    URL: string;

    { Gain (how loud the sound is).
      They are mapped directly to respective OpenAL source properties,
      so see OpenAL specification for exact details what they mean.
      In short:

      @unorderedList(
        @item(Gain scales the sound loudness. Use this to indicate that
          e.g. a plane engine is louder than a mouse squeak (when heard
          from the same distance).

          Do @italic(not) make the actual sound data (in wav, ogg and such files)
          louder/more silent for this purpose.
          This is usually bad for sound quality. Instead, keep your sound data
          at max loudness (normalized), and use this @link(Gain) property
          to scale sound.

          It can be antything from 0 to +infinity. The default is 1.)

        @item(MinGain and MaxGain force a minimum/maximum sound loudness.
          These can be used to "cheat" around default distance attenuation
          calculation.

          These must be in [0, 1] range. By default MinGain is 0 and MaxGain is 1.)
      )

      Note that Gain value > 1 is allowed.
      Although OpenAL may clip the resulting sound (after all
      calculations taking into account 3D position will be done).
      The resulting sound is also clamped by MaxGain
      (that generally must be in [0, 1], although some OpenAL implementations
      allow values > 1).

      When this sound is used for MusicPlayer.Sound:
      @orderedList(
        @item(MinGain, MaxGain are ignored.)
        @item(Effective Gain (passed to OpenAL sound source) is the

      engine examples for details (@code(examples/audio/sample_sounds.xml)
      contains an example file with lots of comments).

      When you set RepositoryURL property, we read sound information from
      given XML file. You usually set RepositoryURL at the very beginning,
      before OpenAL context is initialized (although it's also Ok to do this after).
      Right after setting RepositoryURL you usually call SoundFromName
      a couple of times to convert some names into TSoundType values,
      to later use these TSoundType values with @link(Sound) and @link(Sound3D)
      methods.

      When OpenAL is initialized, sound buffers will actually be loaded.

      If this is empty (the default), then no sounds are loaded,
      and TRepoSoundEngine doesn't really give you much above standard
      TSoundEngine.

      If you want to actually use TRepoSoundEngine features
      (like the @link(Sound) and @link(Sound3D) methods) you have to set this
      property. For example like this:

      @longCode(#
        SoundEngine.RepositoryURL := ApplicationData('sounds.xml');
        stMySound1 := SoundEngine.SoundFromName('my_sound_1');
        stMySound2 := SoundEngine.SoundFromName('my_sound_2');
        // ... and later in your game you can do stuff like this:
        SoundEngine.Sound(stMySound1);
        SoundEngine.Sound3D(stMySound1, Vector3(0, 0, 10));
      #)

      See CastleFilesUtils unit for docs of ApplicationData function.

        (so you should correct your code to set @link(TRepoSoundEngine.RepositoryURL)
        early enough), or that you specified invalid sound name.
        When Required = @false, missing sound is silently ignored,
        which is sensible if it was optional.

        Regardless of the Required value, we return stNone for missing sound.

          (although I think that at some time I experienced similar
          problems (that would be cured by this workaround) on Linux
          (Loki OpenAL implementation)).

          The problem: music on some
          levels doesn't play. This happens seemingly random: sometimes
          when you load a level music starts playing, sometimes it's
          silent. Then when you go to another level, then go back to the
          same level, music plays.

          Investigation: I found that sometimes changing the buffer
          of the sound doesn't work immediately. Simple
            Writeln(SoundInfos.List^[Sound].Buffer, ' ',
              alGetSource1ui(FAllocatedSource.ALSource, AL_BUFFER));
          right after alCommonSourceSetup shows this (may output
          two different values). Then if you wait a little, OpenAL
          reports correct buffer. This probably means that OpenAL
          internally finishes some tasks related to loading buffer
          into source. Whatever it is, it seems that it doesn't
          occur (or rather, is not noticeable) on normal game sounds
          that are short --- but it's noticeable delay with larger
          sounds, like typical music.

          So the natural workaround below follows. For OpenAL implementations
          that immediately load the buffer, this will not cause any delay. }

        { We have to do CheckAL first, to catch eventual errors.
          Otherwise the loop could hang. }
