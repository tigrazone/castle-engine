This directory contains a local copy of Kraft sources,
to easily compile them together with Castle Game Engine.
This is a convenience (to compile Castle Game Engine with physics
support out-of-the-box, without requiring you to download anything
besides Castle Game Engine repository and FPC),
you can always remove it and use original Kraft unit from
https://github.com/BeRo1985/kraft .
